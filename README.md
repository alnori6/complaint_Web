# Complaint Webpage

## About The Project

This project was developed to streamline the complaint submission and resolution process, solving four key challenges commonly faced in B2B operations:
	1.	Reduced Resolution Time: The time required to address issues has significantly decreased.
	2.	Secure Record Management: Emails and complaint reports cannot be lost, ensuring all records are traceable.
	3.	Enhanced Productivity: Boosts the efficiency and productivity of Customer Care employees.
	4.	Instant Feedback: Enables immediate feedback from customers, fostering improved communication.



## Why This Project Is Useful

Efficient complaint management is essential for maintaining strong B2B relationships. This project simplifies and automates key aspects of the complaint process, leading to better issue resolution and improved customer satisfaction.




## Drawbacks

While the project provides numerous advantages, there are some limitations:
	•	It currently focuses only on B2B complaints and may require additional customization for B2C scenarios.
	•	Scalability for larger organizations with multi-departmental workflows may need further enhancements.




 ## Architecture

1. Complaint Form

This page includes an auto-fill feature for basic information, reducing errors when entering details such as airport names, emails, and issue categories.

3. Customer Care Employees

This section includes a login pop-up for Customer Care employees. It enables them to access filed complaints, address them efficiently, and update information for the follow-up pages visible to customers.

## Training and Development

This project was developed as part of my summer training at Saudi Ground Services (SGS). During this period, I attended multiple courses in aviation and safety.

My main role was as a Product Developer in the Commercial Department. I worked on improving the Hayakum UI/UX website project while contributing to the Customer Care section to enhance user experience and efficiency.
